# Evolutionary_Computation
<p>
This source codes are done under a project assignment. Below are the tasks needed to be done.<br>

The password requirements:
1. The password must have at least 12 characters
2. Combination of upper case letters, lower case letters, number and symbols
3. Not defined from dictionary or a name of a person, product or organization
</p>

## Part 1: Experiment
<p>
A) How many generation do you need to hack it? <br>
B) How much time do you need to hack it? <br>

C) Experiment your genetic algorithm model with: <br>
1. Mutation only
2. Crossover only
3. Mutation + Crossover
4. Population Size
5. Crossover techniques (1 or 2 point etc)

Compile your results in a table <br>

</p>

| Experiment | Mutation Rate | Crossover Technique | Population Size | Generation to Solve | Time Complexity | Name file |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 0.5 | one-point | 100 | 1500 | 8 hr | p1_3a_1.py |



## Part 2: Creation
<p>
Experiment with EXTENDED TECHNIQUES (eg: 2 populations, co evo). Compile the results similar to the above table. <br>
1. Come up with your own formulation of a problem. **Must be creative and not found in Google.**
2. Example: Optimizing hyperparameters of a Machine Learning problem using EA
3. You can have "uneven chromosomes" or "weighted chromosomes"
</p>
